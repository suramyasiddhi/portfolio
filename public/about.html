<p>Hello! My name is Suramya Siddhi. I am currently 19, born on 12th July 2004. I am learning new and exciting things in the world of web development and coding. I am a fresher in college and am trying to learn as many things as possible and as quickly and efficiently ofcourse as possible.
  As of now, I have learnt C++ and C at a mediocre level I'd say. Things are still going on.
</p>
<p>So that's all I've to say. Hope that next time when you guys see my website will be much advanced and interactive.</p>
<h5>Thank you!</h5>
